js-playground
=============

My javascript playground

Im using html5boilerplate - http://html5boilerplate.com/
May the gods bless them for their help

Example of view and sub views in backbone.js
Usefull if u are lost in the sea of events and need a working example
Written because i was having bad time in developing a particular application for work
Shared in the hope someone will find it useful

My mods to the HTML5Boilerplate fall under their licence

My bit of js instead is GPLv3
